# Sensible word templates for R Markdown

The default Word templates look absolutely horrible.
In this repository, I will improve the basic styles in a word template for to be a bit more sensible with used with R Markdown.

There's a package called [`officedown`](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officedown-for-word.html) which provides more tweaking of word seetings than what the ordinary R Markdown stuff provides, but initially I'll see how far I can get with simply using R Markdown (and the `bookdown` extension package).

~~I will draw on instructions from [`officedown`](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officedown-for-word.html) and [basic use of a **.docx** template](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/word-template.html) for R Markdown.~~

~~To use, start by installing `officedown` from GitHub with `remotes::install_github("davidgohel/officedown")`~~
